# 100 Days Of NLP - Log

### Day 1: 29 May, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chapter 2 of Natural Language Processing in Action (NLPiA). Reviewed one-hot vectors and bag-of-words, learned 5 ways to do a dot product multiplication.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure I like this book, it uses too many metaphors and explanations for obvious things and progresses very slowly. Hopefully it will pick up later.

### Day 2: 30 May, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chapter 2 of Natural Language Processing in Action (NLPiA). Reviewed tokenization, n-grams, lemmatizer and stemmers, learned about precision/recall tradeoffs with them and dangers of using stop words.

**Thoughts:** I am starting to like the book, it has quite interesting discussion of possible pipelines/worklows

### Day 3: 1 June, 2019


**Today's Progress**: (Almost) finished Chapter 2 of NLPiA. Spent most of the time trying to install NLPiA package.

**Thoughts:** I still can't use conda etc very well and Windows is very inconvenient for that

**Link to work:** none today


### Day 4: 2 June, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Installed Anaconda and NLPia on Ubuntu and set everything up. Finished Chapter 2 (Named Entity Recognition) of BioNLP; halfway through chapter 3.

**Thoughts:** Ubuntu is much less scary than I thought! On the other hand, BioNLP seems to be *extremely* hard.

**Link to work:** none today



### Day 5: 3 June, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter 2 on NLPiA, trained and tested a Naive Bayes classifier based on skitlearn.

**Thoughts:** There were many mistakes in the scripts in the book, so the progress was slow, but I am learning a lot when things do not work as expected. Probably I should examine the scripts before trying to run them.
