# 100 Days Of NLP - Log

### Day 1: 29 May, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chapter 2 of Natural Language Processing in Action (NLPiA). Reviewed one-hot vectors and bag-of-words, learned 5 ways to do a dot product multiplication.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure I like this book, it uses too many metaphors and explanations for obvious things and progresses very slowly. Hopefully it will pick up later.
